<h3>Bill Bragg</h3>
<p>Hey there, I'm Bill!</p>

<p>I'm a Madison, WI based IT analyst. With three years of development experience, I bring current knowledge about web and applications development and the adaptability to take on an organization's constantly changing technological challenges.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm an IT analyst intern at Alliant Energy. We keep the lights on.</p>

<p>Formerly, I worked at the University of Wisconsin, where I worked in front-end development at the Department of IT and in browser applications development at the Morgridge Institute for research.</p>

<p>In addition to a degree in web software development, I keep my skills current through online coding and learning communities including the #100DaysOfCode, Github, CodeSchool, and FreeCodeCamp.</p>

<p>Please get in touch and let's continue the conversation.</p>
